# Athlete_Injury_Prediction
Machine learning pipeline to predict injuries in collegiate athletes using training, performance, and demographic data, with model evaluation and feature analysis.

# Athlete Injury Analysis Pipeline

## üìñ Project Overview
This project implements a **full machine learning pipeline** to predict injuries in collegiate athletes. The pipeline includes:

- Data loading and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering and preprocessing  
- Training multiple machine learning models  
- Model evaluation and comparison  
- Saving the best-performing model for deployment  

The goal is to help coaches and trainers identify risk factors for athlete injuries and make informed decisions to improve player safety and performance.

## üóÇ Dataset
The dataset `collegiate_athlete_injury_dataset.csv` contains information about collegiate athletes, including physical measurements, training patterns, performance, and injury history.

### Columns:
- **Demographics:** `Age`, `Gender`, `Position`, `Height_cm`, `Weight_kg`  
- **Training metrics:** `Training_Intensity`, `Training_Hours_Per_Week`, `Recovery_Days_Per_Week`, `Match_Count_Per_Week`  
- **Performance metrics:** `Fatigue_Score`, `Performance_Score`, `Team_Contribution_Score`, `Load_Balance_Score`  
- **Target variable:** `Injury_Indicator` (0 = No injury, 1 = Injury)

---

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for missing values, duplicates, and unique counts.  
- Visualized numeric distributions with histograms and KDE plots.  
- Correlation heatmap to identify relationships between features and injury risk.  
- Countplots to see distribution of **Position** and **Injury_Indicator** by **Gender**.  
- Barplots and scatterplots to explore relationships between training metrics, fatigue, performance, and injury incidence.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing
Before training models, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

1. **Categorical encoding:**
   - `Gender`: Male = 0, Female = 1  
   - `Position`: Guard = 0, Center = 1, Forward = 2  

2. **Feature scaling:**  
   - All numerical features scaled using `StandardScaler` for normalization.  

3. **Selected features for modeling:**
   ```text
   Age, Gender, Position, Height_cm, Weight_kg,
   Training_Intensity, Training_Hours_Per_Week,
   Recovery_Days_Per_Week, Match_Count_Per_Week,
   Fatigue_Score, Performance_Score,
   Team_Contribution_Score, Load_Balance_Score

   ü§ñ Applied Machine Learning Models

The pipeline applies multiple models to compare performance:
